I lived most of my life with my below the knee amputation so that I nearly can´t remember what is life with to legs. I think you call it lbk. In 2004 doctors advise me that  I need to have a reampuation above my knee. At first I disavowed it and denied this. I had a lot surgeries over the years on my stump because there were very often different problems with it. It got worse and worse so I had inexpressible pain. I consulted different doctors in Lithuania and Germany and all told me that I will need this surgery and that it is only a question of time when it has to be done. So I adjusted with it. I am now since a few month an above the knee amputee. You would call it LAK I think. At first I was very frightened when I saw it because I didn´t imagine my stump that short when my doctors talked about the way it will be. Now I can say it was a good decision because I can walk again every day a bit better and I have nearly no pain anymore.
